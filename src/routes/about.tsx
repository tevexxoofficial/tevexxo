              <p>
                Tevexxo started in 2020 with a simple frustration: too much business software was
                being delivered by whoever was cheapest, then quietly abandoned. We wanted to build
                the other kind — systems with owners, documentation and a future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today we split our time between client platforms and our own product suite. Running
                products keeps us honest: we live with the same decisions we recommend, including
                the maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                We stay deliberately small. Every engagement is staffed by senior practitioners who
                stay from the first workshop to the handover, which is the only way we know to keep
                quality predictable.
